P5JS


P5JS is a JavaScript Library which focuses on creating sketches using code. Not limited to only sketches, you can create your whole site using P5JS using methods to code HTML objects similar to PHP. For more information please visit https://p5js.org/

To install open any terminal and type:
```
 npm i -g p5js
```
If you rather use the online web editor instead of installing, please visit https://editor.p5js.org/

We want to install globally as we’ve encountered a few issues when installed locally.

Next place the Sketches folder into your user documents folder, this is where P5JS will look when creating and running sketches.
```
For example :	C:\Users\shane\Sketches
```
Now we are all set. To create a sketch we can use the command:
```
p5js new <sketch> --run
```
To run and open an existing sketch such as fractalplant we use :
```
p5js run fractalplant –code
```
